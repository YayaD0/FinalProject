<h1> SANITY SPACE </h1>
<h2> An Informative Space about Mental health </h2>
<p>  <strong> &#129504; Mental health is a growing problem & many are left without any resources. I chose Mental health as my final project topic because life comes with challenges and many people go through stuff and alot of the times instead of speaking to someone or reaching out for help it is ignored which is overall unhealthy. In the Sanity Space we hope to provide a informative platform about mental health. </strong> </p>

<h3> What is Mental Health?</h3>

<p> <strong> &#129504; Mental health falls under emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It is important because it plays a big part in the way one think, feel, and act.

It is important that information about mental health is out there so that it is possible to detect or help someone in need.</strong> </p>
